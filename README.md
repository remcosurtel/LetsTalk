# LetsTalk MVC Assignment

This application is written for an assignment by Let's Talk.

## Approach

Given my limited experience with web development, I chose to use a language that I am familiar with: Python.
I followed an online [tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-authentication-to-your-app-with-flask-login) for the creation of a simple web application with authentication via Flask-Login.
From there, I intend to add further functionality to satisfy the requirements of the assignment. (TODO)

## Technologies used

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
